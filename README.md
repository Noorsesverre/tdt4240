# Shipocalypse

## Structure
The project is organized into four main parts, a (currently disabled) desktop launcher, an android launcher, core (the code for the game), and assets which are textures and spritework the game uses.

There are also gradle files for downloading dependencies and compiling the game.

## Compiling and running
For compiling and running the game, we recommend using Android Studio. 


1. Download and install both git and Android Studio if you have not done so already.

2. Clone the repository into a location of your choice on your PC using git.<br/>
  `~$ git clone https://github.com/Noorsesverre/tdt4240`

3. Open the folder (tdt4240) with Android Studio. All the necessary packages to compile the program will automatically start downloading.

4. Create a new Android App configuration using the android launcher module.

5. Enable developer mode on your Android device of choice, enable USB debugging in developer settings, and connect it to your PC with a USB connection. Alternatively, set up a virtual android device.

6. Select your device on the devices in the top dropdown menu, and hit run. The game should now compile, and be loaded and run on your physical or virtual android device.
